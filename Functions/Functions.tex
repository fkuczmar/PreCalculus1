\section{Interpreting Graphs, Translating Between Math and English}

\begin{example}  \label{ExFun1}

The function
\[
   g = f(v) , 20 \leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
expresses the gas mileage (in miles/gal) of a car in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). Translate each of the following into mathematics.

\pskip

% f(v)=40-0.02(v-50)^2 

\noindent (a) What is the car's gas mileage at a speed of 40 miles/hour?

\noindent (b) At what speeds does the car get 32 miles/gal?

\noindent (c) At what speeds does the car get at least 32 miles/gal?

\noindent (d) At what speeds is the gas mileage less than it is at 40 miles/hour?

\noindent (e) At what speeds does the car get the same gas mileage as it does at a speed of 44 miles/hour?

\noindent (f) At what speeds is the mileage 10 miles/gal greater than it is at 20 miles/hour?

\noindent (g) Find the change in the gas mileage if the speed increases from 60 miles/hour to 70 miles/hour.

\noindent (h) Find the average rate of change in the mileage with respect to speed if the speed increases from 60 miles/hour to 70 miles/hour. Include units.

\noindent (i) At what speeds does an increase of 10 miles/hour in the speed leave the gas mileage unchanged?

\noindent (j) At what speeds does an decrease of 10 miles/hour in the speed increase the mileage by 2 miles/gal?

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{ExFun2}

The function
\[
   g = f(v) , 20 \leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
expresses the gas mileage (in miles/gal) of a car in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). Translate each of the following into everyday Engish.

\pskip

\noindent (a) Solve the inequality $f(v)\leq 38$.

\noindent (b) Solve the equation $f(v) \leq f(45)$.

\noindent (c) Solve the inequality $f(v) \leq f(45)$.

\noindent (d) Solve the equation $f(v)> f(50)-4$.

\noindent (e) Solve the equation $f(v)=f(v-8)$.

\noindent (f) Evaluate $f(w)$.

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{ExFun3}
Use the graph of the function 
\[
    g = f(v) , 20\leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
shown below and the sliders to find approximate answers to each of the following questions.

(a) What is the car's gas mielage at a speed of 30 miles/hour?

(b) At what speeds does the car get 35 miles/gal?

(c)  At what speeds does the car get at least 35 miles/gal?

(d)  At what speeds does the car get at most 35 miles/gal?

\section{Graphing Functions}

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:Bugs1}
Play the slider $u$ to activate the motion of the point $P$ below.

(a) Sketch by hand a graph of the function 
\[
   s=f(t), 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\] 
that expresses the distance (in cm) between $P$ and $A$ as a function of the number of seconds since the motion started.

Then activate the folder on Line 9 by clicking the circle at the left of the line. Play the slider $u$ again and check if your graph is correct.

(b) On the same coordinate system, sketch a graph of the function 
\[
   s=g(t), 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\] 
that expresses the distance (in cm) between $P$ and $B$ as a function of the number of seconds since the motion started.

Then activate the folder on Line 17 by clicking the circle at the left of the line. Play the slider $u$ again and check if your graph is correct.
