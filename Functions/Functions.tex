\section{Interpreting Graphs, Translating Between Math and English}

\begin{example}  \label{ExFun1}

The function
\[
   g = f(v) , 20 \leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
expresses the gas mileage (in miles/gal) of a car in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). Translate each of the following into mathematics.

\pskip

% f(v)=40-0.02(v-50)^2 

\noindent (a) What is the car's gas mileage at a speed of 40 miles/hour?

\noindent (b) At what speeds does the car get 32 miles/gal?

\noindent (c) At what speeds does the car get at least 32 miles/gal?

\noindent (d) At what speeds is the gas mileage less than it is at 40 miles/hour?

\noindent (e) At what speeds does the car get the same gas mileage as it does at a speed of 44 miles/hour?

\noindent (f) At what speeds is the mileage 10 miles/gal greater than it is at 20 miles/hour?

\noindent (g) Find the change in the gas mileage if the speed increases from 60 miles/hour to 70 miles/hour.

\noindent (h) Find the average rate of change in the mileage with respect to speed if the speed increases from 60 miles/hour to 70 miles/hour. Include units.

\noindent (i) At what speeds does an increase of 10 miles/hour in the speed leave the gas mileage unchanged?

\noindent (j) At what speeds does an decrease of 10 miles/hour in the speed increase the mileage by 2 miles/gal?

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{ExFun2}

The function
\[
   g = f(v) , 20 \leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
expresses the gas mileage (in miles/gal) of a car in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). Translate each of the following into everyday Engish.

\pskip

\noindent (a) Solve the inequality $f(v)\leq 38$.

\noindent (b) Solve the equation $f(v) \leq f(45)$.

\noindent (c) Solve the inequality $f(v) \leq f(45)$.

\noindent (d) Solve the equation $f(v)> f(50)-4$.

\noindent (e) Solve the equation $f(v)=f(v-8)$.

\noindent (f) Evaluate $f(w)$.

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{ExFun3}
Use the graph of the function 
\[
    g = f(v) , 20\leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
shown below and the sliders to find approximate answers to each of the following questions. But first translate each English question into mathematics and each mathematical question into English.

(a) What is the car's gas mileage at a speed of 30 miles/hour?

(b) At what speeds does the car get 35 miles/gal?

(c)  At what speeds does the car get at least 35 miles/gal?

(d)  At what speeds does the car get at most 35 miles/gal?

(e) Solve the inequality $f(v)> 50$.

(f) Solve the inequality $f(v)<50$.

(g) At what speeds is the gas mileage $25\%$ less than it is at a speed of 50 miles/hour?

Use the graph of the function 
\[
    g = f(v) , 20\leq v \leq 75 ,
\]
shown below and the sliders to find approximate answers to each of the following questions. But first translate each question into English.
\begin{exploration}\label{exp:Fun4}

\pskip

(a) Solve the equation $f(v) = f(v+23)$.

(b) Solve the equation $f(v) = f(v-23)$.

(c) Solve the equation $f(v) = f(v+10) + 5$.

(d) Solve the inequality $f(v) < f(v+23)$.

\section{Graphing Functions}

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:Bugs1}
Play the slider $u$ to activate the motion of the point $P$ below.

(a) Sketch by hand a graph of the function 
\[
   s=f(t), 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\] 
that expresses the distance (in cm) between $P$ and $A$ as a function of the number of seconds since the motion started.

Then activate the folder on Line 9 by clicking the circle at the left of the line. Play the slider $u$ again and check if your graph is correct.

(b) On the same coordinate system, sketch a graph of the function 
\[
   s=g(t), 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\] 
that expresses the distance (in cm) between $P$ and $B$ as a function of the number of seconds since the motion started.

Then activate the folder on Line 17 by clicking the circle at the left of the line. Play the slider $u$ again and check if your graph is correct.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:Bugs2}
This is a continuation of the last exploration where the motion of point $P$ is the same as before, but we vary the position of point $A$. The function 
\[
   s=f(t), 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\] 
still expresses the distance (in cm) between $P$ and $A$ as a function of the number of seconds since the motion started.

Our purpose here is to see how this graph changes as we change the position of $A$. Drag the slider $w$ below to change the position of $A$.
