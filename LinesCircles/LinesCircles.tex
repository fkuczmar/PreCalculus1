\begin{question} \label{Qdsfr3gg5rtgt}
Find the coordinates of the points on the circle with equation
\[
   x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 6y = 0
\]
closest to the point $(-7,0)$. Start by completing the square to find the circle's center and radius.
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdft45432423}
Find equations of all circles with radius $5$ through the points $A(-3,2)$ and $B(1,-1)$. Start by finding an equation of the set of points that are centers of the circles through $A$ and $B$. Do not use anything you might know about the perpendicular bisector of a segment.
