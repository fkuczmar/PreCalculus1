\end{question}


\begin{example}     \label{Ex99:Quadratics}
Let 
\[
   f(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , -5 \leq x \leq 5 .
\]

(a) Use your knowledge of circles to sketch a graph of the function $y=f(x)$ by hand.

(b) Explain what it means for a funtion to be one-to-one.

(c) Is the function $f$ one-to-one? Explain your reasoning.

(d) Explain what it means for a relation to be a function.

(e) Is the inverse of $f$ a function? Explain your reasoning.

\begin{explanation}

(a) Since 
\[
    y = \sqrt{25-x^2},
\]
we know that $y \geq 0$. Then squaring both sides and doing some algebra (you should fill in the details) gives
\[
    x^2 + y^2 =25 \text{ and } y\geq 0.
\]
The curve 
\[
   x^2 + y^2 = 25
\]
is a circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. But since $y\geq 0$, the graph (not shown) of the function $y=f(x)$ is a semicircle in the first and second quadrants with endpoints $(5,0)$ and $(-5,0)$.

(b) A function is one-to-one if any two distinct inputs have distinct outputs.

(c) The function $f$ is {\bf not} one-to-one. We can see this because the two inputs $x=-5$ and $x=5$ give the same output
\[
     f(\pm 5) = \sqrt{25-(\pm 5)^2} = 0 .
\]

We can also see that $f$ is not one-to-one from the graph. There are many horizontal lines that intersect the graph in two points. This means that there are many pairs of inputs that give the same output.

(d) A relation is a function when each input has exactly one output.

(e) Because $f$ is not one-to-one its inverse is {\bf not} a function. For example, the input $y=0$ to the inverse relation would have two outputs, $x=-5$ or $x=5$, making the inverse relation not a function.

\end{explanation}

\end{example}


\begin{example} \label{Ex98:Quadratics}
Let 
\[
    y=   f(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , 0\leq x \leq 5 .
\]

(a) Use your knowledge of circles to graph the function $y=f(x)$ \emph{by hand}. Use the graph to thoroughly explain why $f$ is one-to-one.

(b) Find an expression for the inverse function
\[
    x = f^{-1}(y)
\]
that expresses the input $f$ in terms of its output. State its domain.

(c) Graph the function $y=f^{-1}(x)$.


\begin{explanation}
(a) The graph of $y=f(x)$ is a quarter-circle in the first quadrant centered at the origin with endpoints $(5,0)$ and $(0,5)$. Since each horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point, any two different inputs to $f$ have different ouputs. This means that $f$ is one-to-one.

(b) We know from the graph in part (a) that the range of $f$ is the set
\[
   \{ y \, | \,  0\leq y \leq 5 \} .
\]
This is the domain of the function $x=f^{-1}(y)$.

Now to find an expression for $f^{-1}(y)$, we solve the equation
\[
   y=   \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , 0\leq x \leq 5 
\]
for $x$. Squaring both sides gives
\[
   y^2 = 25 - x^2 .
\]
So 
\[
     x^2 = 25-y^2
\]
and 
\[
   x  = \pm \sqrt{25-y^2} .
\]

To decide which sign to choose, we go back to the domain of $f$, where we are given that 
\[
     0 \leq x \leq 5 .
\]
Since $x\geq 0$, this means we must choose the positive sign and so
\[
    x = f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{25-y^2}.
\]
We should also include the domain $0\leq y \leq 5$ (as stated above). So the inverse of the function
\[
    y=   f(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , 0\leq x \leq 5 
\]
is the function
\[
    x = f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{25-y^2} \, , 0\leq y \leq 5 .
\]

(c) Since the variables $x$ and $y$ have no practical meaning, we can switch them in our expression for $x = f^{-1}(y)$. So the inverse of the function
\[
    y=   f(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , 0\leq x \leq 5 
\]
is the function
\[
    y = f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{25-x^2} \, , 0\leq x \leq 5 .
\]
This is identical to the function $f$. That is, $f$ is its own inverse and the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are identical.
