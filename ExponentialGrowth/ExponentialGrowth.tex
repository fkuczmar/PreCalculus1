A population that grows \emph{linearly} increases at a constant absolute rate, perhaps at the rate of $20,000$ people/yr. 

A population that grows \emph{exponentially} increases at a constant \emph{relative} rate, perhaps at the rate of $20\%$/yr. To understand what this means, suppose the population was $P$ at the start of the year 2020. Then one year later the population would be $20\%$ greater, or 
\[
   P + 20\% P  = P + 0.2 P = 1.2P .
\]
We call 1.2 the \emph{annual growth factor}. To get the population one year from, we just multiply the current population by this factor of 1.2

\begin{question}   \label{Q6:ExponentialG}
The world population was approximately 1.5 billion in 1900 and 2.5 billion in 1950. Assume that between 1900 and 2023 the population grew exponentially.

\begin{question}   \label{Q88:ExponentialG}
Suppose that between sea level and an altitude of 10 km, the air pressure is an exponential function of altitude. Suppose further that the pressure is 14.7 pounds/(square inch) at sea level and 10.17 pounds/(square inch) at an altitude of 3 km.

\begin{question}   \label{Q22:ExponentialG}
(a) Suppose that a colony of bacteria has a population of 100,000 at 1pm and a population of 490,000 at 4pm. Find functions 
\[
   P = f(t) \, , 0\leq t \leq 10 ,

Use point-slope for $f$. {\bf Explain the logic behind the expressions for each function.}

Enter these functions in the worksheet below. Compare their behaviors over the given domain.

(b) Compare the steps  you took in finding the functions $f$ and $g$ in part (a) in the following way:

i) Think of the first step in finding the linear function as finding the change in the population from 1pm to 4pm. How did you modify this step for the exponential function?

ii) The second step in finding the linear function is determining the average growth rate. How did you modify this step for the exponential function?

iii) The third step in finding the linear function (really two steps at once) is to add the change in the population from 1pm to time $t$ hours past noon to the population at 1pm. How did you modify this step for the exponential function?

iv) You used three arithmetical operations in finding the linear function - subtraction (Step 1), multiplication (Steps 2 and 3), and addition (Step 3). What operations replaced these in the exponential function?



(c) Repeat part (a) assuming the population is $a\times 10^3$ at 1pm and $b\times 10^3$ at 4pm. Use the parameters $a$ and $b$, not specific numbers. Then open the Sliders Folder in Line 1 by clicking the arrow at the left of the folder's name. Vary the sliders for $a$ and $b$ and describe how the graphs change. Be sure to consider a decreasing population.


(d) For part (c), find fully-simplified expressions (in terms of $a$ and $b$) for the populations at 2:30pm.

\[
   f(t) = P_0 (2^{t/33}) \, , -10\leq t \leq 50 ,
\]

(b) The function 
\[
   m = m_0 \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^{t/1300} \, , -10,000\leq t \leq 1000 ,

\begin{question}   \label{Q9:ExponentialG}
Suppose both the population and national debt of a small country grow exponentially. The population doubles every 20 years and the national debt doubles every 12 years. How long does it take the per-capita (ie. per-person) share of the national debt to double?
\[
    \answer{30} \text{ years}
\]
\end{question}



\begin{question} \label{Q24:ExponentialG}
The function 
\[
   P = f(t) \, , -40\leq t \leq 60 ,
\]
expresses the population of a small country (measured in hundreds of thousands of people) in terms of the number of years since 1900. Assume that the popluation increases between 1860 and 1960 and interpret the meaning of each of the following expressions.

(a) $f^{-1}(20)$

(b) $f(f^{-1}(20) + 30)$

(c) $f^{-1}(1.44 f(30))$

\pskip

Now assume that the population increases by $20\%$ every 10 years and evaluate each of the above expressions. Explain your reasoning. Do {\bf not} find an explicit expression for the inverse function nor refer to logarithmic functions in any way.


\end{question}


\begin{question}   \label{Q10:ExponentialG}
Returning to the scenario of Question 7, 

(a) find a function
\[
    P = g(T) \, , 0\leq T \leq 373 ,
\]
that expresses the population in terms of the number of years since 1650. 

{\it Hint:} First express $t$ (the number of years since 1900) in terms of $T$.

(b) Use your function from part (a) to find a function
\[
  A = g_1(T) \, , 0\leq T \leq 373 ,
\]
that expresses the land area (measured in billions of hectares) needed to feed the world population as a function of the number of years since 1650 (see the caption to Figure 10 below and assume the present (1970) productivity level).

(c) Use your function from part (a) to find functions
\[
  A = g_2(T)  \text{ and } A = g_3(T)\, , 0\leq T \leq 373 ,
\]
that express the land area (measured in billions of hectares) needed to feed the world population as a function of the number of years since 1650 at levels of productivity double and quadruple the 1970 level).

(d) Find a function
\[
    A = h(T) \, , 250\leq T \leq 373 ,
\]
that expresses the area (in billions of hectares) available for agriculture as a function of the number of years since 1650. Assume there were 3.2 billion acres available in 1900 and that each additional person added to the population after 1900 required 0.08 hectares of arable land for infrastructure that rendered that land unavailable for agriculture.
