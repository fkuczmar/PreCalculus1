A population that grows \emph{linearly} increases at a constant absolute rate, perhaps at the rate of $20,000$ people/yr. 

A population that grows \emph{exponentially} increases at a constant \emph{relative} rate, perhaps at the rate of $20\%$/yr. To understand what this means, suppose the population was $P$ at the start of the year 2020. Then one year later the population would be $20\%$ greater, or 
\[
   P + 20\% P  = P + 0.2 P = 1.2P .
\]
We call 1.2 the \emph{annual growth factor}. To get the population one year from, we just multiply the current population by this factor of 1.2

\begin{question}   \label{Q6:ExponentialG}
The world population was approximately 1.5 billion in 1900 and 2.5 billion in 1950. Assume that between 1900 and 2023 the population grew exponentially.

(a) What is the one-year growth factor? Give an exact value and then an approximate value to 4 decimal places.
\[
   \text{Exact growth factor }  \answer{(5/3)^{1/50}} \hskip 0.3 in  \text{Approximate growth factor } \answer{1.0103}
\]

(b) Use the exact growth factor to find a function
\[
     P = f(t) \, , 0\leq t \leq 123 ,
\]
that expresses the population (measured in billions of people) in terms of the number of years past 1900.

\[
   f(t) = \answer{1.5 \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^{t/50}}
\]

(c) Use your function to predict the world population in 2023. How does this compare with the actual population?

\begin{question}   \label{Q7:ExponentialG}
Suppose that between sea level and an altitude of 10 km, the air pressure is an exponential function of altitude. Suppose further that the pressure is 14.7 pounds/(square inch) at sea level and 10.17 pounds/(square inch) at an altitude of 3 km.

(a) What happens to the air pressure when the altitude increases by 3 km?

(b) What happens to the air pressure when the altitude increases by 1 km?

(c) Find a function
\[
    P = f(h) \, , 0\leq h \leq 10,
\]
that expresses the pressure (measured in lbs/(square inch) in terms of the altitude (measured in kilometers). Enter the function below.
\[
      f(h) = \answer{14.7(10.17/14.7)^{h/3}} \, , 0\leq h \leq 10 .
\]

(d) Enter your function in Line 1 of the exploration below (ie. replace the incorrect function $f(h)=14.7-h$ with the correct one) and use the graph to estimate the altitude at which the pressure is 7 lbs/(square inch).
