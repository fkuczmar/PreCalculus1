Pairs of inverse functions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

The action of putting on your shoes and the action of taking off your shoes are inverses. Each undoes the other. The actions of adding 4 and subtracting 4 are also inverses of each other. If you first add 4 to any number and then subtract 4 from the result, you end up with your original number. And subtracting 4 from a number and then adding 4 to the result brings you back to your original number. 

The last example was really about functions. Inverse functions come in pairs and each undoes the other. For example, the functions 
\[
    f(x) = x + 4
\]
and 
\[
  g(x) = x-4
\]
are inverses. For example,
\[
    g(f(23)) = g(23+4) =  (23+4) -4 = 23
\]
and
\[
    f(g(23)) = f(23-4) = (23-4) + 4 = 23 .
\]

\begin{question}   \label{Q1:Inverses}
Simplify the compositions $g(f(x))$ and $f(g(x))$ for the functions $f$ and $g$ above. Explain.
\end{question}

When the functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of each other, we write $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$ or $f(x) = g^{-1}(x)$. So, for example, for 
\[
   f(x) = x+4 ,
\]
the inverse function is
\[
   f^{-1}(x) = x-4.
\]

{\bf Note:} The notation $f^{-1}(x)$ for the inverse can be misleading. While, for example $3^{-1} = 1/3$ means the reciprocal of $3$, the function $f^{-1}(x)$ is {\bf not} the reciprocal of $f(x)$. So in the example above, the reciprocal
\[
     \frac{1}{f(x)} = \frac{1}{x+4} 
\] 
is not the same as the inverse $f^{-1}(x) = x-4$.


\begin{example} \label{Ex1:Inverses}
The function
\[
    C = g(F) = \frac{5}{9}\left( F - 32  \right) , F\geq -460 ,
\]
expresses the Celsius temperature in terms of the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature.
