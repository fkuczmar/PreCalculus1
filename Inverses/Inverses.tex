Pairs of inverse functions.

\maketitle

The action of putting on your shoes and the action of taking off your shoes are inverses. Each undoes the other. The actions of adding 4 and subtracting 4 are also inverses of each other. If you first add 4 to any number and then subtract 4 from the result, you end up with your original number. And subtracting 4 from a number and then adding 4 to the result brings you back to your original number. 


\begin{example} \label{Exd445t667}
The above example about adding and subtracting 4 was really about functions. Inverse functions come in pairs and each undoes the other. For example, the functions 
\[
    f(x) = x + 4
\]
and 
\[
  g(x) = x-4
\]
are inverses. For example,
\[
    g(f(23)) = g(23+4) =  (23+4) -4 = 23
\]
and
\[
    f(g(23)) = f(23-4) = (23-4) + 4 = 23 .
\]

To show algebraically that the functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of each other, we should simplify the compositions $g(f(x))$ and $f(g(x))$. For the first composition
\begin{align*}
          g(f(x)) &= g(x+4)  \\
                    &= (x+4) - 4 \\
                    & = x .
\end{align*}
This shows that $g$ undoes $f$. To show that $f$ undoes $g$, we need to show $f(g(x))=x$. Here's the computation:
\begin{align*}
          f(g(x)) &= f(x-4)  \\
                    &= (x-4) + 4 \\
                    & = x .
\end{align*}


\end{example}



When the functions $f$ and $g$ are inverses of each other, we write $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$ or $f(x) = g^{-1}(x)$. So, for example, for 
\[
   f(x) = x+4 ,
\]
the inverse function is
\[
   f^{-1}(x) = x-4.
\]

{\bf Note:} The notation $f^{-1}(x)$ for the inverse can be misleading. While, for example $3^{-1} = 1/3$ means the reciprocal of $3$, the function $f^{-1}(x)$ is {\bf not} the reciprocal of $f(x)$. So in the example above, the reciprocal
\[
     \frac{1}{f(x)} = \frac{1}{x+4} 
\] 
is not the same as the inverse $f^{-1}(x) = x-4$.


\begin{example}  \label{Ex:4577hhhh}
Find an expression for the inverse of the function
\[
    y= f(x) = 4x -3 
\]
and show algebraically that you are correct.

\begin{explanation}
The function $f$ expresses the output $y=f(x)$ in terms of the input $x$. Our goal in finding an expression for the inverse is to express  $x$ as a function of $y$. That is, we are looking to solve the above equation for $x$ in terms of $y$. This will give us an expression $x=f^{-1}(y)$ for the inverse function. 

One approach is to think about the action of $f$. The function $f$ first multiplies its input by $4$ and then subtracts $3$ from the result. To undo this process we first undo the second action (subtracting $3$) by adding $3$. Then we undo the first action (multiplying by $4$) by multiplying by the reciprocal $1/4$. The result is that
\[
     x =    f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{4} \left( x+3 \right) .
\] 

A second, more algebraic approach is to solve the equation $y=4x-3$ for $x$ in terms of $y$ as follows.

Since 
\[
    y = 4x - 3, 
\]
\[
         y + 3 = 4x ,
\]
and
\[
    x = f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1}{4}\left( y + 3 \right) .
\]

Now since $x$ and $y$ are dummy variables (ie. they do not have any practical meaning in this example), we can write the inverse function as 
\[
       y = f^{-1}(x) =  \frac{1}{4}\left( x+3 \right) .
\]

To show algebraically that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are actually inverses of each other, we need to show that $f^{-1}$ undoes $f$ and that $f$ undoes $f^{-1}$. For the first, we simplify the composition $f^{-1}(f(x))$:
\begin{align*}
        f^{-1}(f(x)) &= f^{-1}(4x-3) \\
                          &= \frac{1}{4}\left( (4x-3)+3 \right) \\
                          &= \frac{1}{4}\left( 4x \right) \\
                          &= x .
\end{align*}

To show that $f$ undoes $f^{-1}$, we simplify the composition $f(f^{-1}(x))$.

\end{example}




\begin{example} \label{Ex4:Inverses}
This example is about the rate at which a car burns gas, measured in gallons/hour. At any instant, this rate depends on the speed of the car and the gas mileage. For example, suppose that a car gets 30 miles/gallon at a speed of 60 miles/hour. Then at this speed the car burns gas at a rate of
\[
     \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{30 \text{ miles/gal}} = 2 \text{ gal/hour}.
\]

This makes sense both unit-wise and logically. In one hour the car travels 60 miles. And since the car burns one gallon of gas every 30 miles, it burns
\[
    \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/gal}} = 2 \text{ gallons}
\]
of gas every hour.

\pskip

Now suppose between speeds of $50$ miles/hour and $78$ miles/hour that that gas mileage of a car (in miles/gal) is a linear function of its speed. Suppose also that the car gets $40$ miles/gal at a speed of $50$ miles/hour and $28$ miles/gal at a speed of $78$ miles/hour.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find a function 
\[
     G = f(v)  ,  \,\, 50\leq v \leq 78 ,
\]
that expresses the gas mileage of the car (in miles/gal) in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). Use point-slope and do \emph{not} simplify your expression.
\[
    G = f(v) = \answer{40-\frac{3}{7}(v-50)} ,  \,\, 50\leq v \leq 78 ,
\]

\item At what rate (in gal/hour) does the car burn gas at a speed of $64$ miles/hour?

\item Use the idea in part (b) to find a function 
\[
     r=h(v) , \,\, 50\leq v \leq 78 ,
\]
that expresses the rate at which the car burns gas (in gal/hour) in terms of its speed (in miles/hour). This is {\bf not} a linear function. You should simplify the function by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number to clear the fractions. %This is {\bf not} a linear function.

\item Express the range of the function $h$ using set notation.

\item Explain the meaning of the function $h^{-1}$. What does it take as an input? What does in return as an output?

\item Find an expression for the function $h^{-1}$. Use the appropriate variables for the input and output.

\item Express the domain of the function $h^{-1}$ using set notation.

\item What should you get if you simplified the composition $h(h^{-1}(r))$? Explain your reasoning.

\item Simplify the composition $h(h^{-1}(r))$ algebraically. Show all steps.

\item At what speed does the car burn gas at the rate of $2$ gal/hour?
