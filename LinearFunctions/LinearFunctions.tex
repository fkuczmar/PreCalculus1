Linear functions are those that change at a constant rate. For example, between 12:10pm and 12:20pm a balloon might ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min or a car might travel at a constant speed of 60 miles/hour. In the first case, the height of the balloon is a linear function of time and in the second the car's odometer reading is also a linear function of time.

It can be misleading to say that the height of the balloon increases 50 feet every minute as this could be interpreted as meaning \emph{only} that the height increases only over each one minute interval starting at 12:10pm (ie. from 12:10pm to 12:11pm, from 12:11pm to 12:12 pm, etc.), whereas in fact the height increases at the average rate of 50 ft/min over \emph{every} time interval between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. Furthermore, saying that the height increases 50 feet every minuteo obscures the units of the rate of change as being ft/min. So it's best to stick with the original wording, that the balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min.

Now most functions are decidedly not linear, even over short periods of time. It is unlikely for a balloon to ascend at a contant rate for very long, nor is it really possible to drive at a constant speed for very long. Nevertheless, most functions are locally linear, or at least approximately so, and it is for primarily this reason that they are very useful. For example, over a short period of time we would expect a balloon to ascend or descend at a nearly constant rate and the speed of a car to be almost constant. 

Over long periods of time, some populations tend to grow exponentially. But over a short period of time, the growth is nearly linear. For a dramatic way to see this, take a look at the website below to see how the U.S. and world populations are growing:

\begin{question} \label{Q1:LF}
Use the above population clock to estimate the rate at which the world population is currently increasing.
\end{question}

We can also see this same phenomenon graphically. Consider, for example, the graph of the function
\[
    T = f(m) , 0\leq m \leq 20 ,
\]
that expresses the temperature (in Celsius degrees) of a cup of coffee in terms of the number of minutes past noon is shown below. The function is not linear. But zoom in close to the point $P$ on the graph.

What do you notice about the graph of the function very close to $P$?

Back to our balloon that ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. To determine its height at any time during this interval, we need to know the height at one specific time. 

\begin{example} \label{Ex2:LF}
Between 12:10pm and 12:20pm a balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min. The balloon is 1428 feet above the ground at 12:13pm. Find a function 
\[
  h = f(t), 10\leq m \leq 20
\]
that expresses the height of the balloon (in feet) in terms of the number of minutes past noon.


\begin{explanation}
Most of you are undoubtedly familiar with the slope-interecept form of an equation of a line, for this example written not as $y=b+mx$, but rather as 
\[
    h=f(t) =h_0 + m t , 10\leq t \leq 20.
\]
This formula relies on knowing the value of $h_0$, ie. the balloon's height (in feet) at 12:00pm. But there is no need to know this height, nor do we have enough information to determine it (since we know nothing about the rate of ascent between noon and 12:10pm). Sure, we could assume that the balloon ascends at a constant rate from 12:00pm to 12:20pm and find the height at noon, but that would be an extra step. Furthermore, it would take our attention away from the motion of the balloon over the {\bf short} time interval between 12:10pm and 12;20pm. So {\bf forget about the slope-intercept formula.} For this class and for future math classes, the focus will be on the point-slope equation of a line.

Rather than just plugging numbers into a formula, let's think about how to find the balloon's height at any time between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. Suppose, for example we wish to determine first the balloon's height at 12:20pm relying on the facts that the balloon is 1428 feet hight at 12:13pm and that it ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min. 

The key is to compute the {\bf change} in the balloon's height from 12:13pm to 12:20pm. Because this time interval lasts 
\[
   (20 - 13) \text{ min } = 7 \text { min}
\]
and the balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min, the change in height is %from 12:13pm to 12:20pm is
\[
  \Delta h = f(20) - f(13) = (50 ft/min)(20 - 13 \text{ min})  = 350 ft .
\]
Then adding this change in height to the balloon's height at 12:13pm (1428 feet) gives the height at 12:20pm as
\[
   f(20) = 1428 \text{ ft } + 350 \text{ ft } = 1778 \text{ ft}.
\]
Putting all the computations in one line, the height at 12:20pm is
\begin{align*}
    f(\textcolor{red}{20}) &= 1428 \text{ ft } + (50 ft/min)( \textcolor{red}{20} - 13 \text{ min}) . \\
\end{align*}
Or omitting the units, 
\[
     f(\textcolor{red}{20}) = 1428  + 50 ( \textcolor{red}{20} - 13 ) . 
\]


Now to find the height at any time $t$ between $10$ and $20$ minutes past noon, we need only replace the \textcolor{red}{20} in the above equation with $\textcolor{red}{t}$. So omitting the units, the balloon's height (in feet) at $t$ minutes past noon is given by the function
\[
   f(\textcolor{red}{t}) = 1428  + 50( \textcolor{red}{t} - 13) , 10\leq t \leq 20.
\]

We should keep our focus on the time interval between 12:10pm and 12:20pm by {\bf stopping} here. No need to distribute and simplify. 

\end{explanation}

\begin{question}   \label{Q3:LF}
Explain the logic behind the above expression for $f(t)$. Include complete explanations (with units) of 

(a) the difference $\textcolor{red}{t} - 13$ ,

(b) the product $50(\textcolor{red}{t}-13)$ , and

(c) the sum 1428  + $50( \textcolor{red}{t} - 13)$  .

Identify each of these three expressions (a) - (c) on the graph below. Include a copy of the graph with your explanation.

Now let's go back to the cooling coffee cup and see if we can approximate the temperature function near the point $P$.

\begin{example} \label{Ex3:LF} The graph of the function
\[
    T = f(m) , 0\leq m \leq 20 ,
\]
that expresses the temperature (in Celsius degrees) of a cup of coffee in terms of the number of minutes past noon is shown below. 

\begin{exploration}\label{Exp1:LF}

(a) Zoom in close enough to point $P$ to be able to get a good approximation to the coordinates of point $Q$. 

(b) Use the coordinates of points $P$ and $Q$ to find an expression for the linear function 
\[
  T = g(m) , 0\leq m \leq 20,
\]
that gives a good approximation to the temperature function $T=f(m)$ for times near 12:05pm. 

Explain your reasoning by following Example \ref{Ex2:LF}.

(c) Graph the linear function $T=g(m)$ by entering the correct expression on Line 16 below.

(d) Zoom in toward $P$ and back out. What can you say about how well the linear function approximates the actual temperature function?

\begin{example}  \label{Ex5:LF}
Suppose that between prices of $\$6.00/\text{burger}$ and $\$10.00/\text{burger}$ the average number of burgers Five Guys in Edmonds sells is a linear function of the price. They sell an average of $200$ burgers/day at a price of $\$6.00/\text{burger}$ and an average of $120$ burgers/day at a price of $\$10.00/\text{burger}$. Find a function that expresses the price in terms of the average number of burgers they sell.

\begin{explanation}
(a) {\bf Start by defining each variable in a complete sentence. Include units in the definitions (the units should be $\$$/burger and burgers/day). Use {\bf meaningful} variable names (a single letter for each). Do {\bf not} use $x$ and $y$.}

\pskip

So here we will let $p$ be the price (in $\$$/burger) and $q$ be the average number of burgers (measured in burgers/day) that Five Guys sells at a pirce of $p$  dollars/burger.

\pskip

(b) {\bf Relate the variables from part (a) with function notation as in Example 2, where we let $T=f(m)$.}

\pskip

The problem asks us to express $p$ as a function of $q$. So we are looking for a function
\[
   p = f(q) , 120 \leq q \leq 200 ,
\]
that expresses the price (in dollars/burger) in terms of the average number of burgers (in burgers/day) they sell.

\pskip

%{\bf Note:} Although the price determines the average number of burgers they sell, the question asks us to express the price as a function of quantity. That isthat if we know the quantity we could determine the price. This is how economists do things.

%\pskip

(c) {\bf Sketch a graph of the function. Label axes with the appropriate variable names and units.}

\pskip 

I'll omit this part, but you should include a graph. In this case the graph of the function $p=f(q)$ would be a line  segment with endpoints $(120, 10)$ and $(200, 6)$.

\pskip

(d) {\bf Next compute the appropriate rate of change of the linear function. Include units in your computation and use the delta notation for changes. Interpret the meaning of the slope.}

\pskip

The rate of change in the price with with respect to the average number of burgers sold is
\[
   \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q} = \frac{(10-6) \text{dollars/burger}}{(120-200) \text{burgers/day}} = -\frac{1}{20} \frac{\text{dollars/burger}}{\text{burgers/day} } .
\]
So if they raise the price by 1 dollar/burger, they sell an average of 20 fewer burgers/day. Or if they raise the price by $\$0.05$/burger, they sell an average of 1 fewer burgers/day.
\pskip

{\bf Do not simplify the units, otherwise it will be impossible to interpret the rate of change.}

\pskip

(e) Use your slope and a known data point to write an expression for the function in point-slope form. Include a domain.

So using the fact that $p=6$ when $q=200$, 
\[
  p = f(q) = 6 - \frac{1}{20} \left( q - 200 \right) , \text{ for } 120\leq q \leq 200, 
\]
or equivalently (using the fact that $p=10$ when $q=120$)
\[
  p = f(q) = 10 - \frac{1}{20} \left( q - 120 \right) \text{ for } 120\leq q \leq 200.
\]
\end{explanation}
{\bf Leave the expressions like this. No need to simplify.}

\end{example}


\begin{example} \label{Ex6:LF}
Suppose that over a certain interval of speeds, the speed of a car is a linear function of its gas mileage. 

\pskip

Choose speeds for the endpoints of this interval and reasonable gas mileages for those speeds. Then find a function that expresses the {\bf speed in terms of the gas mileage} by following the steps in Example 8.
