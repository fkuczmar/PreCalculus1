Linear functions are those that change at a constant rate. For example, between 12:10pm and 12:20pm a balloon might ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min or a car might travel at a constant speed of 60 miles/hour. In the first case, the height of the balloon is a linear function of time and in the second the car's odometer reading is also a linear function of time.

It can be misleading to say that the height of the balloon increases 50 feet every minute as this could be interpreted as meaning \emph{only} that the height increases only over each one minute interval starting at 12:10pm (ie. from 12:10pm to 12:11pm, from 12:11pm to 12:12 pm, etc.), whereas in fact the height increases at the average rate of 50 ft/min over \emph{every} time interval between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. Furthermore, saying that the height increases 50 feet every minuteo obscures the units of the rate of change as being ft/min. So it's best to stick with the original wording, that the balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min.

Now most functions are decidedly not linear, even over short periods of time. It is unlikely for a balloon to ascend at a contant rate for very long, nor is it really possible to drive at a constant speed for very long. Nevertheless, most functions are locally linear, or at least approximately so, and it is for primarily this reason that they are very useful. For example, over a short period of time we would expect a balloon to ascend or descend at a nearly constant rate and the speed of a car to be almost constant. 

Over long periods of time, some populations tend to grow approximately exponentially. But over a short period of time, the growth is nearly linear. For a dramatic way to see this, take a look at the website below to see how the U.S. and world populations are growing:

We can also see this same phenomenon graphically. Consider, for example, the graph of the function
\[
    T = f(m) , 0\leq m \leq 20 ,
\]
that expresses the temperature (in Celsius degrees) of a cup of coffee in terms of the number of minutes past noon shown below. The function is not linear. But zoom in close to the point $P$ on the graph.

Back to our balloon that ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. To determine its height at any time during this interval, we need to know the height at one specific time. 

\begin{example} \label{Ex2:LF}
Between 12:10pm and 12:20pm a balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min. The balloon is 1428 feet above the ground at 12:13pm. Find a function 
\[
  h = f(t), 10\leq m \leq 20
\]
that expresses the height of the balloon (in feet) in terms of the number of minutes past noon.


\begin{explanation}
Most of you are undoubtedly familiar with the slope-interecept form of an equation of a line, for this example written not as $y=b+mx$, but rather as 
\[
    h=f(t) =h_0 + m t , 10\leq t \leq 20.
\]
This formula relies on knowing the value of $h_0$, ie. the balloon's height (in feet) at 12:00pm. But there is no need to know this height, nor do we have enough information to determine it (since we know nothing about the rate of ascent between noon and 12:10pm). Sure, we could assume that the balloon ascends at a constant rate from 12:00pm to 12:20pm and find the height at noon, but that would be an extra step. Furthermore, it would take our attention away from the motion of the balloon over the {\bf short} time interval between 12:10pm and 12;20pm. So {\bf forget about the slope-intercept formula.} For this class, and for your future math class, the focus will be on the point-slope equation of a line.

Rather than just plugging numbers into a formula, let's think about how to find the balloon's height at any time between 12:10pm and 12:20pm. Suppose, for example we wish to determine first the balloon's height at 12:20pm relying on the facts that the balloon is 1428 feet hight at 12:13pm and that it ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min. 

The key is to compute the {\bf change} in the balloon's height from 12:13pm to 12:20pm. Because this time interval lasts 
\[
   (20 - 13) \text{ min } = 7 \text { min}
\]
and the balloon ascends at a constant rate of 50 ft/min, the change in height is %from 12:13pm to 12:20pm is
\[
  \Delta h = f(20) - f(13) = (50 ft/min)(20 - 13 \text{ min})  = 350 ft .
\]
Then adding this change in height to the balloon's height at 12:13pm (1428 feet) gives the height at 12:20pm as
\[
   f(20) = 1428 \text{ ft } + 350 \text{ ft } = 1778 \text{ ft}.
\]
Putting all the computations in one line, the height at 12:20pm is
\begin{align*}
    f(\textcolor{red}{20}) &= 1428 \text{ ft } + (50 ft/min)( \textcolor{red}{20} - 13 \text{ min}) . \\
\end{align*}
Or omitting the units, 
\[
     f(\textcolor{red}{20}) = 1428  + 50 ( \textcolor{red}{20} - 13 ) . 
\]


Now to find the height at any time $t$ between $10$ and $20$ minutes past noon, we need only replace the \textcolor{red}{20} in the above equation with $\textcolor{red}{t}$. So omitting the units, the balloon's height (in feet) at $t$ minutes past noon is given by the function
\[
   f(\textcolor{red}{t}) = 1428  + 50( \textcolor{red}{t} - 13) , 10\leq t \leq 20.
\]

We should keep our focus on the time interval between 12:10pm and 12:20pm by {\bf stopping} here. No need to distribute and simplify.
