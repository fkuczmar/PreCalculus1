Composing functions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle


Composing functions is a lot like composing actions. For example, consider the actions of putting on your socks and putting on your shoes. Two key points. First is that order matters. We get a completely different result if were to first put on our shoes and then our socks. And depending on how flexible your socks are, it might not even be possible to put your socks over your shoes.

The second point is that to undo the compostion of first putting on your socks and then your shoes, we undo the two actions in the \emph{reverse} order - we first take off our shoes and then our socks. And whether we're talking about socks and shoes or functions, it pays to remember this idea.

\begin{example}  \label{Erer54r56t364}
Use the graphs of the functions $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ below to find approximate answers to the following questions. Drag points $A$ and $B$ as needed to help with your approximations. Use set notation to write solution sets when solving an equation.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Evaluate $f(g(-2))$.

\item Evaluate $g(f(0))$.

\item Solve the equation $g(f(x))=10$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = 10$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = 5$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = 11$.

\item Solve the equation $g(f(x)) = -10$.

\item Solve the equation $g(f(x)) = 0$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = 0$.

\item Solve the equation $f(f(x)) = 6$.

\item Solve the equation $g(g(x)) = 2$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = f(g(3))$


\end{enumerate}

\end{example}


\begin{example}  \label{Ex0:Comp}
Let
\[
    f(x) = \frac{24}{x^2-x-6}
\]
and 
\[
    g(x) = \frac{3x-5}{x-4} .
\]


Answer each of the following questions \emph{without} using the quadratic formula. Use set notation to write solution sets when solving an equation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluate $f(g(3))$.

\item Evalute $g(f(0))$.

\item Solve the equation $g(f(x))=23/10$.

\item Solve the equation $g(f(x)) = 17/8$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = -4$.

\item Solve the equation $f(g(x)) = -6$.

\item Solve the equation $g(g(x)) = 2$.

\item Solve the equation $f(f(x)) = -4$.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{explanation}
(a) To evaluate a composition, we work our way from the inside out. So to evaluate $f(g(3))$, we first evaluate $g(3)$ to get
\[
    g(3) = \frac{(3)(3)-5}{3-4} = -4 .
\]
Then we input $g(3) = -4$ into the function $f$ to get
\[
   f(g(3)) = f(-4) = \frac{24}{(-4)^2 - (-4) -2} = \frac{4}{3} .
\]


\end{explanation}

\end{example}

\begin{explanation}
(a) To evaluate $g(f(7))$, we first use the graph to approximate $f(7)$. To do this, drag point $A$ to have coordinates $(7,0)$ and read off the $y$-coordinate of the point where the vertical line through $A$ intersects the graph. This tells us that $f(7)= 3$. Now use the expression for $g$ to get
\[
     g(f(7)) = g(3) = \frac{3}{3-5} = -3/2.
\]

(b) To evaluate $g(f(3))$, we do the same as in part (a). From the graph we know that $f(3)=5$. Then
\[
  g(f(3)) = g(5) = \frac{5}{5-5} = \frac{5}{0}
\]
and so $g(f(3))$ is undefined.

(c) To evaluate $f(g(10))$, we first evaluate $g(10)$ to get
\[
     g(10) = \frac{10}{10-5} = \frac{10}{5} =2.
\]
Then use the graph of $f$ to see $f(2) \sim 3.2$. Our conclusion is that 
\[
    f(g(10)) =f(2) \sim 3.2 .
\]
