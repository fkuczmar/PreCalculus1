\section{Points on a Circle}

\begin{question} \label{QDEWWD3w339832}

Consider the circle of radius $9$ cm centered at the point $A$ with coordinates $(3,1)$ cm.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sketch this circle.

\item Describe the circle geometrically. 

\item Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the point $Q$ with coordinates $(11,6)$ lies on the circle. Annotate your picture to help with your explanation.

\item Find the coordinates of four points on the circle. Make this easy.

\item Find the exact coordinates of four other points on the circle. Do not use a calculator.

\item Find an equation of the circle. Explain your reasoning. 

Start by saying the point $P$ with coordinates $(x,y)$ (measured in cm) lies on the circle if and only if the distance from $P$ to the center $A$ with coordinates $\answer{(3,1)}$ cm is equal to $\answer{9}$ cm.

So algebraically, the point $P$ with coordinates $(x,y)$ (measured in cm) lies on the circle with center $A(3,1)$ cm and radius $9$ cm if and only if
\[
     \answer{\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y-1)^2}}  = 9 .
\] 


\end{enumerate}
