Here are some sample finals. They are \emph{not} necessarily indicative of the exact types of problems you will see on the final, nor are they meant to be an exhaustive list of all the types of problems. But they should give you some general idea of what to expect.

Neither calculators or notes will be permitted. 

\section{Sample 1}

\begin{question}  \label{Q34gt4r5t4t44}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an equation of the circle centered at the point $A(3,-5)$ that passes through the point $Q(-4,-1)$.

\item Explain the \emph{logic} behind your equation.
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qdftr4tytuiiii}
Use the methods of \emph{our class} to find an equation of the circle through the points $A(2,1)$, $B(-3,4)$, and $C(-1,-3)$. Explain your reasoning. 

\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qhjk88654g6}
The function 
\[
         T =  f(h) , 0\leq h \leq 24,
\]
expresses the temperature (in Fahrenheit degrees) in terms of the number of hours past midnight on a summer day in Seattle.

Translate each of the following questions into mathematics. Each translation must begin with a verb.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the temperature at 2:00pm.

\item When was the temperature $73^\circ$F?

\item When was the temperature the same as it was at 5:00am.

\item When was the temperature $5$ Fahrenheit degress less than it was as 4:00pm?

\item When was the temperature at least $5$ Fahrenheit degress less than it was as 4:00pm?
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qsdfsdftiii}
Let 
\[
        f(t) = t^2 - 10t + 1 .
\]
Do \emph{not} rely on the quadratic formula in solving these equations. Write a concluding sentence with a solution set where appropriate.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve the equation $f(x) = 10$.

\item Solve the equation $f(t) = f(9)$.

\item Find all inputs to the function $f$ that are equal to their outputs.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
